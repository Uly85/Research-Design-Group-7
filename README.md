**Does a raise in yearly increments improve tenures of Google software engineers?**

Marcus Loke, Anni Yi, Romauli Butarbutar, Yusen Zhang

### Executive Summary

Due to the pervasive culture of attrition in the tech industry in the United States, companies like Google has to deal with constant productivity losses and bottlenecks when employees leave, the knowledge drain exacerbated by the outgoing staff and the loss of revenue due to the lack of manpower. At Google, the mean tenures of employees is 1.9 years (Swanner, 2017), which is not an optimistic figure when compared to other industries. As such, there is a need to reduce the attrition rates in order to not impede productivity for the business.

Among the myriad factors that could affect employee retention, this research investigates solely on increasing salary increments and its effect on employee retention as pay is cited as one of the top reasons for employees leaving their jobs (Ghapanchi & Aurum, 2011, Deloitte, 2019 and The Dice, 2020). Here, we specifically want to know whether a 5% increment in salary at the end of the first year would result in higher mean tenures as compared to a baseline of 2.7%.

The research design focuses on Google software engineers who have been at least 6 months to a year with Google across 4 different offices in the United States (San Francisco, New York City, Sunnyvale and Chicago) and they will be sampled randomly. As a result of the random sampling across the 4 office locations, we should expect similar proportions of software engineers in demography and not be confounded by other unknown factors.

The research will run for 1.5 years in order to cover the mean tenure of 1.9 years. The salary increment (2.7% and 5%) will be dispensed at the 1 year mark for each employee that crosses the 1 year mark.

Finally, the comparison of results (mean tenures) between the treatment group and the control group would be done via a two-sample t-test with a one-sided alternative to check for statistical significance. We assume that an effect size of 0.5 years to be meaningful and measurable.

In order to have an idea of how the actual data might look like once the study is conducted, we also performed simulations using random number generators and scenario planning to create hypothetical data. We simulated the experiment a 1000 times under an effect of 0.5 years and another 1000 times under no effect and the result suggested that our experiment could achieve a power of 90.4% with the current research design setup to detect an effect size of 0.5 years.


**Statement of the Problem**

Why do so many tech employees choose to leave their jobs? In 2018, the tech sector in the United States suffered the highest turnover rates (13.2%) as compared to other industries such as media and entertainment (11.4%), government/non-profit (11.2%) and financial services (10.8%) (viGlobal, 2018). Given the pervasive turnover within the workforce, should such culture be accepted in HR talent acquisition and management teams, especially in tech companies? Or are there preemptive strategies that can be employed to tackle attrition?

High turnover has adverse effects on the business. From a monetary standpoint, the amount that the company needs to spend on a replacement staff can range from one to seven times the employeeâ€™s annual salary, and this is due to many factors including, inter alia, the cost and time to find replacements and the revenue contribution attributed to that employee (Kochanski & Ledford, 2001). Other impacts include low morale for the team and bottlenecks caused by the laborious efforts needed to onboard incoming staff, exacerbated by the knowledge drain of the outgoing staff.

At Google, the median tenure of employees is 1.1 years (mean of 1.9 years), as compared to the United States median tenure of 4.7 years for tech occupations (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2018), which is an area of concern especially with the tech talent shortage in the industry and the increased demands of the technology market. According to PayScale, a company that aggregates the average tenures of Fortune 500 companies, Google stands at 462nd place for its low employee retention rate (PayScale, n.d.). For this reason, this paper seeks to explore whether an increase in yearly increment percentages will improve the employee retention/tenure at Google.

**Research Question and Hypotheses**

**Research Question**
Contingent on the aforementioned reasons, the primary research question that we would like to address is:

Can a salary increment of 5% at the end of the first year increase the average tenure for Google software engineers in the United States?

**Hypotheses**

Null Hypothesis With Mathematical Notation
Since the the average year on year increment for tech companies in 2019 was 2.7% (US Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2021), it would be interesting to examine whether a 5% increment on yearly salaries would have an effect on retention for Google software engineers. Therefore, we propose the following null hypothesis:

A salary increment of 5% at the end of the first year does not increase the average tenure of Google software engineers.
